# 🚀 NYC Parking Ticket Scraper - Enhanced Edition

## 🎯 Latest Improvements Implemented

### 💾 **1. Immediate Data Saving**
- **Problem Solved**: No more data loss if scraper stops unexpectedly
- **Implementation**: 
  - Results saved immediately after each violation number is processed
  - Individual files: `results/violation_{number}_{timestamp}.json`
  - Master file: `results/all_tickets_live.json` (updated in real-time)
  - Backup files: `backup/` directory with periodic saves
  - Emergency saves on interruption or errors

### 🔍 **2. Stealthy Search Filters Interaction**
- **Problem Solved**: More human-like behavior on search results page
- **Implementation**:
  - 70% chance to attempt interaction with `//*[@id="search-filters"]`
  - Human-like mouse movements to the element
  - Sometimes clicks, sometimes just hovers
  - Gracefully handles if element not found
  - Additional random behavior after interaction

### 🏖️ **3. Random Wandering Breaks**
- **Problem Solved**: Breaks detection patterns by acting like real user
- **Implementation**:
  - Random breaks every 8-15 searches (or 5% chance each search)
  - Visits 2-3 random legitimate websites during break
  - Simulates real browsing: clicks, scrolling, realistic timing
  - Break sites: Google, Reddit, Wikipedia, Weather, CNN, BBC, etc.
  - 5-15 second browsing time per site
  - Safely returns to main scraping window

### 🏠 **4. Smart Base URL Return**
- **Problem Solved**: Seamless continuation after breaks
- **Implementation**:
  - Automatically returns to NYC parking ticket site after breaks
  - Closes extra tabs opened during wandering
  - Waits for page to load with human-like behavior
  - Verifies violation input field is ready before continuing
